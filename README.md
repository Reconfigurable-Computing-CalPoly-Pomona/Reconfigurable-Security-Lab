# Reco-DryGASCON
A hardware implementation of the DryGASCON algorithm that allows for parameterization in the code for any size of message. GASCON referering to a Generalized ASCON and Dry refering to the Dry Sponge construction which is derived from the Duplex Sponge construction. The goal of this project is to implement this algorithm with a variety of HDLs, written to allow for customization of every component.
